# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1.Hardware – PCs

2.Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1.Define a function.

2.Get the two numbers from the user.

3.Compare the two values, to find the smaller number.

4.Use for() and if() loop to find the GCD of the two numbers.

## Program:

```python
import math
def gcd():
    a=int(input())
    c=int(input())
    b=math.gcd(a,c)
    print("GCD of two numbers is:",b)    

```

## Output:
